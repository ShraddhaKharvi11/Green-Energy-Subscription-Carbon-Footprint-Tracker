Project Title:
Green Energy Subscription & Carbon Footprint Tracker

Problem Statement:
A Salesforce-powered platform for renewable energy subscriptions and carbon footprint tracking. Customers subscribe to solar/wind plans, earn badges for eco-friendly actions, and view CO₂ savings. Dashboards and alerts promote sustainability and green energy adoption

Phase 1 
Problem Understanding & Industry Analysis
1. Requirement Gathering
We need to define what your Salesforce app must achieve:
•	Customers can subscribe to solar/wind energy plans.
•	System tracks carbon savings (based on energy usage).
•	Gamification: customers earn points & badges for eco-friendly actions.
•	Reports/Dashboards: total CO₂ reduced, usage per customer, leaderboards.
•	Alerts/Notifications: when customer usage crosses limits.
•	Integration possibility: IoT/Smart Meter or manual energy data entry.

2. Stakeholder Analysis
•	Primary Stakeholders:
o	Customers (end users who subscribe).
o	Company Admin (sets plans, manages subscriptions).
o	Sustainability Manager (reviews CO₂ savings).
•	Secondary Stakeholders:
o	Energy Providers (partners, optional).
o	Regulators (reporting compliance, optional).
________________________________________
3. Business Process Mapping
Example flow:
1.	Customer subscribes to a renewable plan.
2.	Energy usage is tracked (manual input or integration).
3.	Carbon savings auto-calculated.
4.	System updates total savings + points.
5.	Customer receives badges/alerts.
6.	Admin monitors via dashboards.

4. Industry-specific Use Case Analysis
•	Renewable Energy Industry: Growing focus on sustainability and carbon neutrality.
•	Salesforce Fit:
o	CRM to manage subscriptions.
o	Custom objects for carbon savings tracking.
o	Gamification via points/badges (could even extend to Loyalty Management if needed).
o	Reports for internal + external sustainability reporting.

5. AppExchange Exploration
Some apps on AppExchange (like Sustainability Cloud) already track emissions — but since we’re building a custom, student/project-focused version, we’ll design simpler custom objects and automation.
(If you want, we could also reference Sustainability Cloud in your final presentation to show “future upgrade path.”)
